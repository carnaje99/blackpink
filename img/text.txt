Black Pink had a gorgeous debut report on August 8, 2016 with the single 'SQUARE ONE'. As a girl group that was introduced after 7 years at YG Entertainment, it announced the birth of a large group of rookies by ranking first on various music charts. 
Since then, Black Pink has grown into a global girl group representing K-Pop, releasing its first mini-album 'SQUARE UP'. This spring, Black Pink is taking another leap forward with an EP album of the same name as the title song 'Kill This Love'.
